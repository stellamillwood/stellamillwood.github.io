  <h2>{{ project.subtitle }}</h2>
  <p>Tajma is a task-based time reporting tool used daily by 11,000+ internal users at the Swedish Public Employment Office. It is built as an Angular 
    web application maintained by me and a full-stack colleague. I owned the front-end and UX design responsibilities—ensuring a stable interface with 
    an intuitive and efficient user experience.</p>
  
  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Migrated the front end to the internal design system, improving layout consistency, accessibility, and long-term code sustainability.</li>
    <li>Improved table accessibility for visually impaired users through iterative user testing and close collaboration with accessibility specialists.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <!--<h2>Before Design System Migration and Accessibility Updates</h2>-->
  <p>When I joined, the application had some aesthetic limitations, did not meet accessibility standards, and the front-end codebase was 
    rigid to work in. The team also received a large volume of reports about accidental week “deliveries” (which disabled editing) and requests 
    for easier access to task descriptions previously offered in a discontinued “day” view.</p>

  <p class="caption">In this view users cannot edit time input because the week has already been "delivered" to the economy department.</p>

  <h2>Design System Migration</h2>
  <p>Migrating to the internal design system involved occasional technical gaps. I contributed improvements directly to the open-source components 
    and collaborated with the design system developers on unresolved issues. I later demoed the results for ~150 colleagues, highlighting the 
    design system’s functionality and potential, which increased awareness and confidence in its adoption.</p>


  <h2>Task Descriptions and Error Prevention</h2>
  <p>Reports about missing task descriptions were few and sometimes indirect, so I conducted five user tests and interviews to understand the underlying 
    workflow. This led to a collapsible task description in the table, reducing time spent switching contexts.</p>

  <p>To address accidental week “deliveries,” I first adjusted copy to clarify consequences (“Deliver week” → “Lock week”) and added explanatory text. 
    Reports decreased significantly. After aligning with the Economy department on requirements, we removed the feature entirely and communicated the 
    change to users.</p>

  <h2>Improving Table Accessibility for Screen Readers</h2>
  <p>After reviewing the organization's accessibility guidelines, I tested Tajma with a visually impaired specialist who relied on auditory and haptic 
    feedback. She described Tajma as unusable. I learned how to use a screen reader and identified several accessibility issues. Through user testing, 
    dialogue with experts, and code adjustments, I made the application usable for visually impaired users and improved accessibility more broadly. 
    Notably, most fixes involved correcting standard code patterns rather than special accommodations.</p>

  <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <p>Further improvements remain, and I am currently working to conduct a full accessibility evaluation of Tajma. Removing week “delivery” partially 
    solved the edit-ability issue, and I see value in future feedback mechanisms that show users their time is saved automatically.</p>
