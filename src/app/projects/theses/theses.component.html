  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This study explores ways of visualizing metadata in virtual reality through means other than text.
    Specifically, we focus on the metadata of a 3D object as a search result and how these visualizations
    can support understanding of the object. The study draws on research from the field of information
    science and is positioned in the domain of cultural heritage. There are few studies about human
    information interaction in virtual reality or metadata visualization in these environments. However,
    metadata can be a useful tool in the information seeking search process. Because its visualization
    should depend on purpose, ways of visualizing metadata other than through text are in need of
    exploration. This study answers the following question: How can descriptive metadata of a 3D search
    result object be visualized in VR to support users’ understanding of the object? A research through
    design approach was employed. Data was collected through interviews about objects with visitors at a
    museum. These interview data were analyzed using a thematic analysis, and the results of that analysis
    were triangulated with the objects’ metadata in a database. This triangulation resulted in sets of
    characteristics and techniques that, as expressed by interviewees, could help them gain an
    understanding of an object of historical and cultural significance. We then selected a smaller set of
    characteristics for implementation using a prioritization matrix, and an object to visualize metadata for.
    Brainstorming sessions generated ways of visualizing these characteristics using relevant techniques.
    The prototype is a virtual reality experience that allows the user to navigate three layers of information
    with visualizations of the 3D object’s characteristics. The prototype was interactively demonstrated
    with four participants and their feedback was documented. The discussion is about the definition of
    metadata, unforeseen designs, the search process, the role of virtual reality in information seeking,
    how metadata visualizations can support understanding of an object and whether our do, our choice of
    using research through design as the approach and the study’s ethical and societal implications and its
    limitations. We conclude that metadata of a search result as an object in VR can be visualized by
    segmenting the VR experience into different layers of information, specifying a sequence in which the
    layers are presented that builds a narrative and provides users with multisensory feedback. We
    encourage future evaluative and comparative studies.</p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This study examines what effect an expert’s (high domain knowledge) search trail has on novices’ (low domain knowledge) benefit for a task of high complexity. Previous studies have examined task complexity and the expert-novice relationship during search. However, the benefit has not yet been extensively studied. Novices are asked to solve a task of high complexity with the optional support of an expert’s search trail. We employ a mixed methods approach and use both quantitative and qualitative data. Methods of data collection include questionnaires and log files. The data are analyzed using search log analysis, charts and a thematic analysis. All novices reused expert terms, but the most commonly reused term did not refer to the task’s complex section. Furthermore, the expert’s search trail was helpful to the novices, but source criticism was challenging, and the need for the search trail diminished during the search process. Additionally, a few novices avoided expert terms, but felt the ones they used were helpful. We conclude that an expert’s search trail is of partial benefit to domain novices. The limitations of the benefit are discussed, and we encourage future work to explore the scope of and reason for these limitations.</p>
