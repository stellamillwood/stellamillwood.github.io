  <p>This <b>two-day project</b> involved designing the UI for Swedish Public Employment Office's new AI-based postal system. The agency processes 
    thousands of citizen documents daily, from medical records to unemployment benefits (A-kassa). Having previous experience in the old postal system, 
    I was familiar with the users, their tasks, and the challenges the new system aimed to address.</p>

  <p>When I reviewed the initial sketches, two things immediately stood out: 
    (1) the information architecture was unclear for users who need to work quickly, and 
    (2) the system’s conceptual model was hidden, requiring users to potentially guess how the new queue and workflow were intended to function. 
    My work focused on clarifying these two aspects through language, hierarchy, and layout.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The Users and Their Tasks</h2>
  <p>Administrators process incoming documents by manually identifying the citizen’s social security number, determining the document type, and 
    importing it into the correct system. The new AI system speeds up this process and introduces a queue where users can assign and unassign 
    documents, with one-click routing to the appropriate system. The development team had created a Figma sketch (as seen below), which I used 
    as a starting point.</p>

  <h2>My contributions</h2>
  <h3>The Queue and Work Space</h3>
  <p>I used our internal design system and applied established design patterns. Working to reduce ambiguity, I reworked copy 
    (“Put back 43 documents…” → “You have 43 unhandled documents…” and “Put back” → “Put back 43 documents in the queue”) 
    so users would understand how many documents remained unhandled and what action the button performed. 
    This aligned language with the workflow the development team intended.

  <h3>The Document Handling Page</h3>
  <p>I structured form fields into sections with hierarchical headings. For instance, the original sketch had “Month” and “Year” fields with no context. 
    I added “Aktivitetsrapporten gäller för” to clarify that the dates refer to the relevant application period. One button was updated from 
    “Delete” to “Download and delete” for clarity. Below you can see first the old document handling page followed by the updated one.</p>

  <p>I added field validation to alert users to missing or incorrect information.  When users pressed “Register document” a 
    confirmation message indicated that the document was successfully registered and the user was now viewing a new document. 
    You can check that out below.

  <h2>In Retrospect</h2>
  <p>I would explore whether the queue and workspace should be combined or further distinguished. Both present lists of files, 
    and combining them could either reduce friction or create confusion. I also see opportunities to refine copy 
    further, such as clarifying the “Download and delete” button. Even in a quick turnaround, small UX decisions—copy, hierarchy, and conceptual 
    clarity—made significant improvements and the development team continued iterating on the redesign.
